OpenSCG slides
==============

This is our new (2016) uniform presentation and training slide collection based on markdown source code converted into PDF slide decks using pandoc and LaTeX.

* [Requirements](#markdown-header-requirements)
* [Directory structure](#markdown-header-directory-structure)
* [Images](#markdown-header-images)
* [Drawings](#markdown-header-drawings)

Requirements
------------

This whole thing works best on Ubuntu.

To build the PDF slide decks from the markdown sources the following software packages need to be installed.

* pandoc
* latex
* libreoffice
* inkscape

pdfpc (PDF presenter console) is a nice multi-display PDF slideshow software which runs under Ubuntu and possibly Mac OS-X.
